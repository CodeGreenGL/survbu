<h3>Introduction:</h3> 

CodeGreen is building a survey builder web application. The application's main functionality is to provide the user with the ability to create, review, update and delete surveys. Each survey will contain its own sections and each section will contains questions within it. When creating new survey the user will have the possibility to reuse(copy) sections if any available.
The user will have to register and comfirm his/her e-mail address, once registered the user will have to log in, in order to be able to create a survey.
